Project: Calculator

This is the fifth project to work in the "JavaScript Basics"

Github page: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-calculator/

(2025/02/06) I complete this project with all knowledges I learned in the whole Foundations Course. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a simple calculator. With advices in Assignment of the project, I design some basic functions for the calculator. Users can do calculations like add, subtract, multiply, divide. Users can input integer or float number, and can change the symbol of numbers as well. This activity strengths my skills and helps me learn the advanced courses.
